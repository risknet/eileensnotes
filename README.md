# eileensnotes

This is a full set of source codes for my first Ruby on Rails application that was built a few years ago.
The application itselt was developed originally in RoR v2.0 and upgraded with Ruby on Rails v4.0.

I was trying to use the most commonly used gems for this applicaiton.

The application is currently running here http://www.eileensnotes.com 

I hope that this set of source codes will be helpful for anyone who is trying to learn Ruby on Rails.
I am currently upgrading this site using the latest RoR with Bootstrap 3, and I will introduce a few key new features as well.

Please share thoughts and provide me some feedbacks.
